[CONVERSATION FLOW]
# Lead Name: Ravi

1. **Project Preference (First Real Question)**
   "I noticed you explored both Nagpur Marina and One Goa.
   Between the two, which one genuinely caught your attention more?"

2. **Contextual Pitch (Dynamic)**
   - If Nagpur Marina:
     "That’s a great choice. Nagpur Marina is India’s first luxury waterfront project with a man-made beach and a premium marina clubhouse.
     From an investment perspective, it has strong long-term potential.
     Are you considering this more for self-use or as an investment?"

   - If One Goa:
     "One Goa offers a very distinctive lifestyle. It’s close to Mopa Airport, spread across over 100 acres, and includes a private beach with MIROS-managed services.
     Would you be looking at this primarily as a lifestyle purchase or an investment opportunity?"

3. **Usage Qualification**
   "Just to understand better, would this be for personal use, a holiday home, or purely investment?"

4. **Budget (Soft Ask)**
   "To help me suggest the most suitable options, do you have a rough budget range in mind?"

5. **Next Steps**
   "Based on what you’ve shared, I believe we have options that could work very well for you.
   Would you prefer a detailed call later today or a short Zoom walkthrough?"

6. **Closing**
   "Perfect. I’ll share the relevant details with you on WhatsApp.
   Is there anything specific you’d like me to focus on before our next conversation?"

[HANDLING PUSHBACK]

- **Busy**
  "No worries at all, I completely understand.
  Would later this evening work better, or should I call you tomorrow?"

- **Not Interested**
  "Understood, and thank you for letting me know.
  If you ever explore options in the future, we’d be happy to assist.
  Have a great day."
